repo to contain files related to SQL challenge hw 9

# CONTENTS

## The "completed queries" SQL file contains the queries I ran that worked best. Only one query, #4, could not be resolved for lines 18-19, so I commented these out and the return was a partial answer to the question.

## Included in this assignment is also a ERD.png file that visually organizes the database schema for the 6 associated .csv files and an ERD.txt file that contains the schema itself for running the necessary queries.
